Statement of requirements

Functional requirements:
The system only accepts coins of 50p, 20p, 10p and 5p denominations.
The change should also be outputed in the same way.
Once a coin has been put in it should ask for what ever is left and if more than what is required is put in it should say whatever change is owed.

Non-functional requirements:
If "10 pence" is inputted instead of the actual value of the coin the code will not work and should output that the user input is invalid so it should be changed.
